# Hands on Epidemic diffusion

To start with this lab, I need you to have this repository in your laptop. 

You can clone or directly download it in a .zip.

Once you have it in your computer, I recommend you to create a virtual enviroment, but as they are very common libraries, you can do:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
